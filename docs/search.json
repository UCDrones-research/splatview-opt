    "text": "Gaussian splatting encodes appearance as view-dependent textures without enforcing angular reflectance models.

This distorts appearance and masks surface detail, leading to unrealistic renderings in affected areas.\nIllumination inconsistency leads to visual incoherence\nSince splats are not normalized across lighting conditions, frames captured under varying sun angles or cloud cover will produce inconsistent brightness and color.

These issues are particularly problematic in photorealistic renderings where smooth transitions are expected.\n\nEmpirical studies have shown that even a small shift in view angle (as little as 2°) can cause reflectance to vary by more than 50%, primarily due to the influence of sun-view geometry and the dominance of directional solar irradiance [1].
