**splatview-opt** is a tool for analyzing and optimizing viewing angles in Gaussian Splat renderings, with a focus on minimizing sun glare and visual hotspots. By simulating real-world lighting conditions, this project helps identify optimal camera orientations for clear, artifact-free visualizationâ€”ideal for outdoor 3D scenes and photorealistic splat-based environments.
